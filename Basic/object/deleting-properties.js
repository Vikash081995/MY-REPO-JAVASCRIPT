//The delete operator removes a property from an object.deleteÂ does not operate on the value of the property but on the property itself:
//----------------------------------------------------------------
let o = {x: 1};    // o has own property x and inherits property toString
delete o.x         // => true: deletes property x
delete o.x         // => true: does nothing (x doesn't exist) but true anyway
delete o.toString  // => true: does nothing (toString isn't an own property)
delete 1           // => true: nonsense, but true anyway
